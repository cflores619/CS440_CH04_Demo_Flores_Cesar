I chose the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE because it is a tpye of free software that allows users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, distribute the software and any adapted versions, and just as it states in the license it is "to make sure it remains free software for all its users." It is developed on the concept of copyleft, professor Price's powerpoint describes it as such "Under copyleft, the developer copyrights the program and releases it under an agreement that allows people to use, modify, and distribute it, or any program developed from it, but only if they apply the same agreement to the new work."
